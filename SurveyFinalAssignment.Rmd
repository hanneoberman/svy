**Introduction**

The Innovation Panel is...

Multistage stratified cluster sampling was used...

Central to this research report are the following research questions: '...'. 

First we look at the sampling design and design weights, next population estimates are computed, and finally the effect of non-response on the estimates is investigated, as well as possible sources of non-response error.

The data:

```{r}
require(survey)
require(sampling)
society <- readRDS("Understanding Society innovation pnel wave A.RDS")
society$a_dvage <- as.numeric(society$a_dvage)
head(society)
```

**Sampling Design**

"Include descriptions of your frame and target and population, intended sample size, and method of sample selection. Discuss potential non-sampling, sampling, and non-response errors" (Assignment 6, fox, 2018).

*1. The Innovation panel would interview multiple people from every household, but in the case households are very large, a Kish Grid is used. Can you explain why the Kish Grid is a popular method to do within-household selection of respondents?*


The Kish Grid method is used to select respondents in a household at random. This method considered to lead to a random sample of household members, and avoids selection bias in the survey. 

It is a popular method because when carried out correctly, it leads to (almost) equal probability sampling, something other selection methods do not obtain. Moreover, the only information you need in order to select respondents is a list containing the names of the persons in the household you want to sample. 


**Design Weights**

*2. Despite the complex data structure, the design weights as included in the variable "a_psnenip_xd" have a very low variance. Can you explain why this is the case?*
As the following table shows, the variance in the design weight variable is `r var(society$a_psnenip_xd)`. With a mean of `r mean(society$a_psnenip_xd)`, the coefficient of variation is only `r sqrt(var(society$a_psnenip_xd))/mean(society$a_psnenip_xd)`.
```{r} 
Var. <- var(society$a_psnenip_xd) #compute variance in the design weight variable
Descr. <- cbind(t(summary(society$a_psnenip_xd)), Var.) #combine with other descriptive statistics
round(Descr., 2) #print with only two decimals
```
The low variance is due to rescaling of the weights, as explained in the IP User Guide (p. 56): "Each set of weights has been scaled by a constant factor to produce a mean of one amongst cases eligible to receive the weight". That is, the design weights are standardized on one. Rescaling, truncating, or smoothing of weights are techniques to inhibit the effect of a single observation on population estimates and its variance. Trimming may yield biased estimates, but is shown to decrease the mean square error (MSE; Lohr, 2010). 

*3. Apart from the design weight, an enumerated design weight "a_psnenip_xw" is also included. Please show using syntax in R how you can calculate this weight.*

The weight a_psnenip_xw was calculated using the design weights (a_psnenip_xd), sex, age and government region. It is known that age was split up in seven groups and the government regions were split up in four, but which ones these were is unknown. To find out, we will start with a linear regression.


```{r}
# First, make the dataset smaller by removing unnecessary columns
society_4 <- society[,-c(5:7,9:56,60:75,77:89)]

# To do so, we need to create dummy variables for government regions
levels(society_4$a_gor_dv)
society_4[society_4$a_gor_dv == "missing",]
society_4[society_4$a_gor_dv == "northern ireland",]
# None of the value are missing or northern ireland, so those can be ignored
society_4$NE <- society_4$a_gor_dv == "north east"
society_4$NW <- society_4$a_gor_dv == "north west"
society_4$Y <- society_4$a_gor_dv == "yorkshire and the humber"
society_4$EM <- society_4$a_gor_dv == "east midlands"
society_4$WM <- society_4$a_gor_dv == "west midlands"
society_4$EOE <- society_4$a_gor_dv == "east of england"
society_4$L <- society_4$a_gor_dv == "london"
society_4$SE <- society_4$a_gor_dv == "south east"
society_4$SW <- society_4$a_gor_dv == "south west"
society_4$W <- society_4$a_gor_dv == "wales"
society_4$S <- society_4$a_gor_dv == "scotland"
# Scotland is the baseline

coeff <- with(society_4, lm(a_psnenip_xw ~ a_psnenip_xd + a_sex + a_dvage + NE + NW + Y + EM + WM + EOE + L + SE + SW + W))
coeff <- coeff$coefficients

# Let us start with government regions.
coeff.gor <- sort(coeff[5:15])
plot(sort(coeff.gor))

```

It is not completely clear which values should be grouped together, despite how nicely the weights are grouped. As can be seen on the map below, where the regions are numbered from the lowest to the highest weight, the grouping is rather strange.

![pic_gov](GOR.png)

The baseline and the other two areas with a weight close to zero are Scotland, London and the West Midlands. Scotland and London are likely candidates to be categories of their own, as Scotland has a strong regional identity and London is the capital of the country. From a data-driven perspective, combining the West Midlands with any region other than London or Scotland does not make sense, as the weight difference between those region and all other regions is relatively big. From a theory-driven perspective, we cannot think of any good reason to combine the West Midlands with London or Scotland: it is not filled with cities nor is it close enough to Scotland to assume a similar population.

When assuming that the regions with a near-identical weight are in the same group and Scotland and London are two seperate categories, only a few possible groupings remain:

1. South East, South West, and North East England are the third category, with Wales and the rest of England being the last category.
- This makes some sense theoretically: the three are the very north and south of England, with the remainder being in the middle. Weight-wise however, combining the West Midlands with the areas with far lower weights does not make sense.

2. The same as above, but with the West Midlands grouped with London.
- This is more logical weight-wise than the first option, but from a theoretical perspective it is strange to combine the city with a rural area.

3. The North West, West Midlands and East of England are the third category, with Wales and the rest of England being the last category.
- Weight-wise it is just as logical or illogical as the first option, but from a theoretical standpoint taking three areas in the middle seems to have less of a basis than taking the outer areas like is done in the first option.

4. The West Midlands alone being the third category, with the rest of England being the fourth.
- This fits weight-wise, but why the West Midlands should be taken seperately is a mystery. It is however less absurd than combining it with London: the West Midlands may have unique features that we do not know about, but we do know that it is not a capital like London.

In conclusion, the fourth option seems the most likely, as the grouping is logical from a data-driven perspective and while it does not quite make sense theoretically, there is no evidence that it is incorrect. The best alternative is the first option, as it makes the most sense from a theoretical perspective.

```


**Population Estimates**
*4. What is the proportion of employed people of working age (15-64) in the population?*
```{r}
# First, we investigate the a_employ variable.
levels(society$a_employ[society$a_dvage > 15 & society$a_dvage < 64])
# The variable a_employ has seven levels.
summary(society$a_dvage[society$a_employ=="yes"])
summary(society$a_dvage[society$a_employ=="no"])
# Yes and no contain people of over 21 years of age.
society[society$a_employ=="missing",]
# Missing does not appear in the data
society[society$a_employ=="inapplicable",]
# Inapplicable seems to contain all children and youths of 21 years and younger
# It cannot be assumed that none of them is employed. It can however be assumed that only a
# small part of them is employed, as children under 15 cannot legally work.
society[society$a_employ=="proxy respondent",]
# No rows returned
society[society$a_employ=="refuse",]
society[society$a_employ=="don\'t know",]
# Both refuse and don't know contain one row. These can be treated as missing data.

# Thus, our goal is to compare the proportion of employed people (yes) of working age against 
# the number of unemployed people (no, inapplicable), excluding the missing data (refuse, don't know)

with(society, society[a_employ=="yes" & a_dvage >64,])
# There are people older than 64 still working, we should take those out. 
with(society, society[a_employ=="yes" & a_dvage <15,])
# No one younger than 15 years is reported to be working, which is to be expected as it was not
# a question asked to people under 21 years of age.

# Since we wish to know the proportion of employed people of working age, we need 2 groups, one with employed adults and one with unemployed adults and employed elderly.
society$employ_dv <- as.numeric(0)
society$employ_dv[society$a_employ=='yes' & society$a_dvage <= 65] <- 1

# Now we can calculate the proportion
# Create design
# Don't remove the missing values yet, as the weights are calculated including missing values 
Design <- svydesign(ids=~a_hidp, strata=~a_strata, data=society, weights=~a_psnenip_xw)
# Make a subset of non-missing values
Nonmiss <- with(Design, subset(Design, a_employ!="refuse" & a_employ!="don\'t know"))
svymean(~employ_dv, Nonmiss)
confint(svymean(~employ_dv, Nonmiss))
# 43,3% of the population is employed, with a 95% confidence interval of 41.4%-45.2%
```

*5. Please investigate the relationship between age and household composition for the population of Great Britain.*

*a. Investigate which age variable you should use.*
There are four variables in the data expressing the age of respondents: a_agegr5_dv, a_agegr10_dv, a_agegr13_dv, a_dvage. The first three are categorical varibles, divided into groups as seen in the UK Labour Force Survey. The fourth variable, a_dvage, denotes the age of respondents in completed years at the moment the interview took place. This was computed by comparing the date of birth and the interview date, or using an estimate (see estimated age variable a_ageest (n = 22), and imputated age variable a_ageif (n = 55)).

The first categorical variable, a_agegr5_dv, contains 15 categories indicating age in five-year partitions up to '70 years or older'. The variable a_agegr10_dv is highly similar, indicating age in ten-year intervals, and consisting of 8 different categories between ages zero and seventy-plus. Finally, a_agegr13_dv consists 13 levels, with unequal age intervals under the age of 20 (namely 0-15, 16-17, and 18-19 years old), five-year intervals between the ages 20 and 64, and a sigle interval containing all ages from 65 years old upward. 

To investigate the relationship between age and household composition, it is necessary to know which households consist of children living at home, and which don't. Presumably, the largest variation between children living at home and those living independently occurs within the age group 15-25 year-olds. If we would use the ten-year intervals to indicate age, we might get less precise estimates, because of the large variance wihtin the age category '10-19 years old'. Therefore, we decided to use an age variable with smaller intervals. Because of the unequal intervals in the age variable with 13 categories, it should be analysed as ordinal variable. To interpret the relationship with household composition, this is not ideal. Ultimately, we decided to use either a_dvage or a_agegr5_dv.


*b. Construct a new variable "household_composition" from the following four variables: "a_livesp_dv, a_cohab_dv, a_single_dv, a_mastat_dv".*
Household composition: 

First, create variable household size:
```{r}
# Household size: count for each household, how many persons there are in. 
# a_hidp - Household identifier
count <- as.matrix(table(society$a_hidp)) # number of occurences of each a_hidp (indicator of size of household)
summary(count)

# create variable to assign household size to each individual person 
society$household_size <- NA 
for (i in rownames(count)) { # for each household..
  society$household_size[society$a_hidp == i] <- count[i,] # maybe this can be written into nicer R code. 
}

# household_type 
# number of children (according to eurostat properties..)

```
 Eurostat distinghuishes three types of variables used to descripte household composition: 
  - Household size;
  - Number of children;
  - Household type, with levels: couple (with/without children), single adult (with/without children), other type of household (with/without children); 
)
  - Number of children. 

First, create variable household size:
Compute variable household size, number of children per household, household type
```{r}

TURN THIS MATRIX INTO DATAFRAME (CHANGE CODE AS WELL.. )
Now, we've got a matrix household_info, containing per household the following information: 
  - Household size;
  - Number of children;
  - Household type, with levels: couple (with/without children), single adult (with/without children), other type of household (with/without children); 

*source* https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Household_composition_statistics

*c.Which weight should you use here?*
For this analysis, we want to use a weight per person (PSN), as it is impossible to calculate age per household. We also want to use the enumeration grid weights (EN), as both age and household composition have no missing values. We want the weights of the first wave (IP), as that is the one we are investigating. Finally, we want to use the stratified weights (XW) rather than the design weights, as we are investigating population values and not sample values. Thus, we want to use the weight a_psnenip_xw, as this is the only weight that covers the correct data in the correct way.

*Lastly, compute population correlation estimate.*

**Non-response**

*6. Not all sample members you included in questions 1-5 participated in the survey. Use the variable "a_ivfio" to investigate how many people personally conducted an interview.*

Of the 3600 individuals in the sample, there are 459 children under the age of ten. These sample members are enumerated individuals, but ineligible for an interview. Therefore, the number of eligible individuals in the sample is 3141. Of these 3141 eligible individuals, only 2656 respondents personally completed an interview. This number consists of 2399 adults who performed a full interview, and 257 interviews with children. Taken together there are 485 cases of (partial) unit nonrespons within the subset of eligible individuals.

Moreover, there are 169 sample members for whom a proxy interview was conducted with a close relative or cohabitant (generally a spouse, partner or adult child; Understanding Society, 'Questions about variables', N.D.). Questions answered on the nonresponders' behalf were used to estimate factual information about the nonrespondent. Information about their beliefs is not collected by proxy, and are therefore indicated as missing (item nonrespons).

Because (partial) nonrespons can lead to nonresponse bias, it is important to investigate the effect of nonresponse on the estimates generated above. Ideally, we would both compare respondents to partial nonresponse, and unit nonresponse. Because of time constraints within this research project, we only investigate unit nonresponse.

```{r}
summary(society$a_ivfio) #what's in the variable?
adults <- sum(society$a_ivfio == "Full interview") #the full interviews with adults
youths <- sum(society$a_ivfio ==  "Youth Interview") #the interviews with children
sum(adults, youths) #all personally completed interviews

NR <- matrix(0, 3600, 1) #create nonresponse indicator
society <- cbind(society, NR) #add to dataframe
#the nonresponse indicator is 1 for all (partial) unit nonresponse
society$NR[which(society$a_ivfio == "Youth: Oth non-int")] <- 1
society$NR[which(society$a_ivfio == "Proxy interview")] <- 1
society$NR[which(society$a_ivfio == "Refusal")] <- 1
society$NR[which(society$a_ivfio == "Other non-intvw")] <- 1
society$NR[which(society$a_ivfio == "Language difficulties")] <- 1
society$NR[which(society$a_ivfio == "Too infirm/elderly")] <- 1
society$NR[which(society$a_ivfio == "Ill/away during survey period")] <- 1
```

*7. Repeat your analysis under question 4. Use only the people who personally did an interview. What is your conclusion? Is there a difference between respondents and nonrespondents when it comes to their employment?*

```{r}
levels(society$a_ivfio)
```

There are forty levels, but by looking at the site (https://www.understandingsociety.ac.uk/documentation/innovation-panel/dataset-documentation/wave/1/datafile/a_indall_ip/variable/a_ivfio), we find only 10 appear in the first wave. Of those, only full interview and youth interview indicate interviews that personally did an interview. Language difficulties is a rather neutral description, but looking at the variable i_proxy:

```{r}
society$a_iproxy[society$a_ivfio=="Language difficulties",]
```

Shows that language difficulty also indicates missing data. Thus, only two of the levels indicate a personal interview and thus should be included for this analysis.

```{r}
I_personal <- with(Nonmiss, subset(Design, a_ivfio=="Full interview" | a_ivfio=="Youth Interview"))
svymean(~employ_dv, I_personal)
confint(svymean(~employ_dv, I_personal))
```

After post-stratfication (as we also included post-stratification in the previous analysis), 46% of the people who did a personal interview is employed, with a confidence interval of 44.9%-49.3%. For the previous question, where all but two people were included, the estimated proportion of the population that is employed was 43,3%, with a 95% confidence interval of 41.4%-45.2%. As neither mean is contained in the 95% confidence interval of the other, it can be concluded that there is a difference between respondents and non-respondents in employment, with respondents being more likely to be employed than non-respondents. 

*8. Using only variables from this dataset, can you find variables which could potentially be useful for constructing nonresponse weights? Why these variables?*
There are several types of nonrepsonse (unit nonresponse, household nonresponse, item nonresponse, and attrition). We're going to look into auxiliary variables that can be useful for constructing weights for unit nonresponse. 

Nonresponse can seriously threat the quality of estimates if the nonresponders differ from the responders in the study. We can adjust for this by the use of auxiliary variables that hold information about the entire sample. We can compare the distribution of the auxiliary variables of the population with its response distribution, and assess whether the response is representative for the whole population. 

If the distributions differ, we must conclude that nonresponse has lead to a nonrepresentative sample. We can adjust for this by constructing nonresponse weights from the auxiliary variables. Then the weighted sample is representative with respect to the auxiliary variables used. Different choices of auxiliary variables lead to different weights. In order to the weights to be useful, it is important to use powerful auxiliary variables (Brick, 2013).

The IP User Guide states that "all models used to predict response propensities as described in the Technical Details are fitted using stepwise backward logistic regression with p=0.05" (p. 56). Compared to other selection strategies, this is a fairly simple one. Considering these other strategies for selecting auxiliary variables for weighting adjustments for nonresponse, we advise to look into Schouten's (2007) proposed strategy of a forward inclusion-backward elimination algorithm and/or S??rndal and Lundstr??m's (2010) paper.  

We opt for a stepwise backwards logistic regression of because this method is similiar to, yet easier to apply than the selection strategies described in Schouten (2007) S??rndal and Lundstr??m's (2010). Most important, this selection strategy was also used in constructing the original weights in the dataset. With this method, we hope to identify variables that predict non-response. 

Steps we want to undertake:
1. Identify nonresponse
2. Identify pool of all possible auxiliary variables 
3. Apply stepwise backwards logistic regression of possible auxiliary variables on nonresponse indicator. 
4. Identify auxiliary variables useful in predicting nonresponse. 

?need to compare every auxiliary variable individually? 

First, we need to divide the population in the respondents and nonrespondents
There are two stages of nonresponse we want to consider: 
* person nonresponse: whether a personal interview was conducted yes or no
* household nonresponse: defined as completian of at least the household grid 

```{r}
society$NR # non response indicator (see Q6)

```
Individual nonresponse is 13.5%

It looks like household nonresponse cannot be identified in this dataset. The levels of variable A_hhresp_dv suggests that all households at least completed the household grid. Even though according to the user guide, the household response should be about 59%. For now, we only take into account individual nonresponse. If available it could also be interesting to use household nonresponse as a potentially useful auxiliary variable. 

Second, we need to identify the variables we want to put into our stewpise logistic regression. Logically, we would use all variables in our dataset but before we do that we need to check the assumptions of logistic regression: 

#1 DV on dichotomous scale
#2 IV(s) should be on continuous or categorical scale 
#3 Independence of observations + the dependent variable should have mutually exclusive and exhaustive categories.
#4 Linear relationship between any continuous independent variables and the logit transformation of the dependent variable. 

We know that assumptions 1-3 hold. We can check assumption 4 with the Box's M test.
Some other issues we haev to deal with: 
- Some of the possible predictors have complete separation for the non-response variable. We will exclude these variables from the model. 
- Multicollinearity between IVs. We think multicollinearity of IVs (for example the different age variables) shouldn't be a problem, since it isn't a strict assumption for logistic regression. 

The method of stepwise logistic regression allows us to look into interactions between auxiliary variables, but in practice this is almost never used (Bick, 2013). However, we do think it is interesting to look into, but because it will make our analysis much more complicated and more difficult to interpret, so for this assignment we will not look into it.

Third, we apply selection strategy:
? don't include weights in svy_design as well when doing logistic regression because they're already corrected for nonresponse..? or aren't they? 

```{r}
auxiliaries <- subset(society, select = c("a_hidp")) #matrix of all possible auxiliary variables 
# auxiliaries <- subset(society, select = c("a_hidp",
#                                           "a_gor_dv"
#                                           
#                                   
#                                           )) #matrix of all possible auxiliary variables 

require(MASS)
# model with all predictors
fullmodel <- glm(person_response ~ 
                   a_gor_dv + a_urban_dv + a_sex + a_racel_dv + 
                   a_employ + a_ageest + a_ageif + a_dvage + a_agegr5_dv + a_agegr10_dv + a_agegr13_dv + 
                   a_marstat + a_livesp +  a_livewith + a_adresp15 + a_adresp17 + a_livesp_dv + a_cohab_dv +
                   a_single_dv + a_mastat_dv + a_depchl_dv + a_rach16_dv + a_respm16_dv + a_respf16_dv + 
                   a_nchild_dv + a_ndepchl_dv 
                   # self-made variables:
                   #household_type + household_size + children
                   , family = binomial, data = society)
# running this gives: fitted probabilities numerically 0 or 1 occured --> perfect separation.. what to do about it? 
# model without those variables:

fullmodel <- glm(person_response ~ a_gor_dv + a_urban_dv + a_sex + a_racel_dv + a_employ + a_dvage + 
                a_mastat_dv # include number of children in hh, kids yes/no, household_size, type, for example.. 
                   , family = binomial, data = society)

summary(fullmodel)

# model without any predictors
emptymodel <- nothing <- glm(person_response ~ 
                             1,
                             family=binomial, data = society )
summary(emptymodel)

# backwards selection
backwards <- step(fullmodel)
summary(backwards)

# forwards selection
forwards <- step(emptymodel,
scope=list(lower=formula(emptymodel),upper=formula(fullmodel)), direction="forward")

# combined model

# show different models: 
formula(fullmodel)
formula(backwards)
formula(forwards)
# formula(combined)

```

Create some tables showing response rates for different categories (age and sex for example.. )
``` {r}
table(society$person_response)
table(society$person_response, )
table(as.matrix(society$person_response), as.matrix(society$a_sex), dnn = c("response", "sex"))
```


Fourth: identify variables: \/Person response: 
The enumerated person weight (A_PSNENIP_XW) is defined for all persons in
households that participated in IP1. The weight equals the IP1 household weight,
post-stratified by age, sex, and grouped Government Office Region. The post-
stratification targets are taken from Office for National Statistics 2008 mid-year
population statistics. /
